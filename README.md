# OverflowClone
This project was originally meant to be a StackOverflow clone for my Cloud Computing course, however, I have evolved it into a general Q&A forum. The UI needs a bit of work, but is usable at the very least. It is being made using Django (for backend and front-end templates) and MySQL.  

Currently still have to implement a :
* Password change mechanism
* Advanced search 
* Popular page
* Discover page 
* Accept answer mechanism 
* Reply mechanism 

Suggestions are valued :)
